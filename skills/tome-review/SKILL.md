# ToME Review

Systematic review and maintenance of the mental model. Keeps it current and accurate.

## When to Invoke

- Weekly (Sunday evening or Monday morning)
- Monthly (first of each month)
- On user request ("review what you've learned about me")
- After a major correction or shift in priorities

## Process

### 1. Gather Data

Read all recent journal entries from the `journal/` subdirectory.

For weekly reviews, focus on last 7 days. For monthly, last 30.

Read the current mental model.

### 2. Extract Patterns

Analyze journal entries for:

**Recurring corrections:**
- Same type of mistake appearing multiple times?
- Pattern: "I keep assuming X, but user prefers Y"
- Action: Strengthen the belief or add a new one

**Consistent approvals:**
- What approaches consistently work?
- Pattern: "User always approves when I do X"
- Action: Promote to high confidence

**Mode patterns:**
- When does the user enter each mode?
- Are there time-of-day, topic, or complexity triggers?
- Action: Refine mode detection heuristics

**Goal evolution:**
- Have immediate/short-term goals changed?
- Any goals completed? New priorities emerged?
- Action: Update current goals section

**Knowledge growth:**
- Topics moved from learning to proficient?
- New areas of exploration?
- Action: Update knowledge state

### 3. Validate Predictions

Review all predictions in journal entries AND the mental model's "Active Hypotheses" section.

**Promotion criteria:**

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Validated (2+ sessions) | Confirmed by evidence across multiple sessions | Promote to stated belief in mental model at 80%+ confidence. Remove from Active Hypotheses. |
| Validated (1 session) | Confirmed once but not yet cross-session | Keep as hypothesis. Boost confidence by 10-15%. |
| Pending (< 2 weeks) | No confirming or disconfirming data yet | Keep watching. No change. |
| Stale (> 2 weeks) | No data after 2+ weeks | Flag for review. Consider rephrasing to be more testable, or retire if untestable. |
| Invalidated | Evidence contradicts prediction | Remove from Active Hypotheses. Update or remove related mental model beliefs. Document why in journal. |

**After validation, create new predictions** based on patterns extracted above. Ensure each prediction specifies:
- What you expect to observe
- How you'd validate it (specific scenario or test)
- Starting confidence level

### 4. Calibrate Confidence

Check prediction accuracy:
- High-confidence predictions (80-100%) — were they right 80-100% of the time?
- Medium-confidence (50-80%) — accurate at that rate?
- Low-confidence (<50%) — appropriately uncertain?

If miscalibrated:
- Overconfident → lower confidence thresholds
- Underconfident → raise confidence thresholds

### 5. Prune Mental Model

- **Completed goals** → remove from current, optionally note in journal
- **Invalidated beliefs** → remove, document why in journal
- **Stale learning events** → keep top 10, archive older ones
- **Superseded patterns** → replace old with new

The mental model should reflect the CURRENT state. History lives in the journal.

### 6. Draft or Apply Changes

**Draft mode (default when automated / cron):**
Write proposed changes to `tome/review-draft.md` instead of modifying the mental model directly. Include:
- What would change and why
- Supporting evidence (journal references)
- Confidence level for each proposed change

Only apply changes that meet a **high confidence bar** (3+ consistent signals across sessions). Everything else goes in the draft for the user to review.

**Direct mode (when user explicitly requests):**
Apply all findings directly to the mental model:
1. Update current goals
2. Adjust values confidence levels
3. Refine communication preferences
4. Update knowledge state
5. Add/remove behavioral patterns
6. Rotate recent learning events

If no meaningful changes are warranted, do nothing. Don't update for the sake of updating.

### 7. Summary

Report to user:
- Key updates made (or proposed in draft)
- Patterns extracted
- Predictions validated/invalidated
- Gaps still to explore
- Next review date
